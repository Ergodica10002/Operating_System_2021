# Operating_System_2021

This repository consists of all machine problems(mp) I did in **NTU CSIE** course *Operating System* in 2021. In all mps we use *xv6*, a simple OS for teaching the *Operating System* course in **MIT**. The system requires docker to build suitable environments for doing the homework, and all images are made by TAs. Besides, all codes and files are directly forked from TAs.
